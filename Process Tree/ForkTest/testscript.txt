This is the result when i call ptreeARM from both the parent and child.
As you can see the parent's child is the child thread as can be seen.
Beneath the first result will be the output when ptreeARM is only called in the child.
Weirdly, the parent process is no where to be seen.

------------------------------------------------------
As you can see the parent only outputs itself and the ppid, which i told it to do.
If you see in the child output, process 218 is the sh process.
The chid's parent id is somehow set to process 1 init. 
According to the fork manual, it says the child process's ppid should be set the parents ppid, so it should be 218.
But this doesn't seem to be true. This is either something wrong with the code that i couldn't fix or this is correct and I misunderstood.
